## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

* Code an icon button that respects accessibility concerns ([MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#accessibility_concerns)).
* Dealing with user-agent stylesheets
  * Remember that headers (e.g. `<h1>`) has default values (e.g. `margin`)
  * Better to use a `reset.css` to reset all of those
